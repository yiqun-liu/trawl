# TRAWL — Requirements

> **TRAWL**: TODO Repository Annotation Work List
>
> *trawl* (verb): to fish with a dragging net; to sift through something
> thoroughly. From Middle English *trawlen*, via Middle Dutch *tragelen*
> (to drag). The tool drags a net through your repository and catches
> every annotation — TODOs, FIXMEs, goal trackers, checklists.

## Overview

TRAWL is a TUI tool for discovering and visualizing work items
embedded in a repository. It scans files for two types of annotations:

- **Goals & Milestones**: structured, multi-week objectives tracked via
  `## GOAL TRACKER` sections in markdown files (courses, books, projects)
- **Inline Tasks**: inline markers in any file (`TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`,
  etc.)

Both are **scanned and auto-discovered** — the user does not register or
configure individual items. They differ in syntax and granularity, not in
discovery method.

The tool renders an interactive terminal dashboard with a hierarchical,
foldable directory tree for inline tasks and a progress-oriented view for
goals. It is designed to be **repo-agnostic**: it works on knowledge bases,
code repositories, configuration repos, or any git-tracked project.

### Design Principles

- **Scan, don't manage**: TRAWL discovers items from file contents. It does
  not store state in a database — the files *are* the database.
- **Pure markdown + inline markers**: no frontmatter, no custom file format.
  Goal trackers are standard markdown sections; inline tasks are standard
  comments.
- **Resilient parsing**: the parser degrades gracefully. Bare `TODO` is
  always valid. Malformed checkbox trees, broken table separators, unknown
  metadata tokens, or unexpected indentation are handled without crashing —
  skip what you cannot parse, parse what you can.
- **Two types, one tool**: goals and inline tasks are independently
  discovered and independently displayed. They are peers, not a hierarchy.
  Do not assume a parent-child relationship between them.
- **Extensible by configuration**: metadata token prefixes (`@`, `#`, `!`,
  `~`) and table column mappings are configurable, not hard-coded.
- **Binary is the product**: the compiled binary is the end-user interface.
  `--help`, the `?` overlay, and error messages are the user contract and
  must stay accurate and complete; the source repo is contributor
  documentation.

## Two Types of Annotations

TRAWL recognizes two types of work items:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ GOALS & MILESTONES  "Complete CS146s"            weeks/months    │
│                     Syntax: ## GOAL TRACKER sections in markdown │
│                     Display: progress dashboard, checkbox tree   │
│                     Tracking: % complete (from checkbox ratio)   │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ INLINE TASKS        "TODO: add cache examples"   minutes/hours   │
│                     Syntax: inline markers (TODO, FIXME, etc.)   │
│                     Display: hierarchical directory tree          │
│                     Tracking: exists/removed, age via git blame  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Why Two Types?

Goals and inline tasks are fundamentally different data:

| Aspect | Goals & Milestones | Inline Tasks |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| Granularity | Days to months | Minutes to hours |
| Source | Authored sections in markdown | Inline markers in any file |
| Volume | A handful at a time | Dozens to hundreds |
| Lifecycle | Tracked through milestones | Resolved by editing the line |
| Structure | Hierarchical (checkbox tree) | Flat (file:line) |
| Progress | Percentage (3/10 tasks done) | Binary (exists or removed) |

### Goals and Inline Tasks Are Independent

Goals and inline tasks are **peers**, not a hierarchy. They are
independently discovered and independently displayed. Many inline tasks
are orphan — minor tasks with no associated goal. Many goals have no
inline tasks in their directory. The tool does **not** assume a structural
parent-child relationship between them.

Note: this principle concerns **goal-to-inline-task** relationships.
**Goal-to-goal** hierarchy via cross-document references is a separate
feature (see [Cross-Document References](#cross-document-references-hierarchical-goals))
and is fully supported.

The only cross-reference to inline tasks is an **optional proximity
filter**: when viewing a goal, the user can optionally ask "show inline
tasks in this goal's directory." This is a convenience filter, not a
structural link. Directory structure does not reliably map to goal scope,
and the tool never assumes it does.

### Cross-Document References (Hierarchical Goals)

A goal tracker can pull in another doc's tracker as a subtree via
`[[wikilink]]` or `[display](path)` markdown-link references. The
reference line becomes the subtree root; the referenced doc's items
become its children. This lets multi-file objectives (a learning track
spread across `README.md` plus per-chapter notes, or an epic spread
across multiple planning docs) aggregate into a single tree.

| Property | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Syntax | `[[target]]` (wikilink) or `[display](target)` (markdown link) |
| Placement | Inside a checkbox, plain bullet, or standalone line |
| Path resolution | Relative to the referencing doc's directory |
| Recursion | Linear chains of any length; cycles detected and rendered as markers |
| Broken refs | Missing file → `⚠ not found`; scanned file with no tracker → `⚠ no goal tracker` |
| Diamond refs | Each appearance gets its own deep-cloned copy |
| Top-level display | A referenced tracker becomes a subtree of its parent and is dropped from the top-level list — each tracker appears once (nested). Mutually-cyclic goals (no outside root) stay top-level |

> References

## Goal Tracker

Goals are structured progress trackers embedded in markdown files via a
`## GOAL TRACKER` section. The section contains checkbox lists or tables
representing milestones and tasks.

**Example:**

```markdown
# Complete CS146s-2025

## GOAL TRACKER

- [x] Week 1: Introduction
  - [x] Lecture 1: How an LLM is made
  - [x] Assignment 1: Basic prompting
  - [ ] Reading: Prompt Engineering Guide !low
- [ ] Week 2: Power Prompting
  - [ ] Lecture 3 !high @yiqun
  - [ ] Assignment 2
```

### Milestones and Tasks

The checkbox tree *is* the hierarchy. No special markers needed:

- A checkbox item **with children** (indented sub-items) = **milestone**
- A checkbox item **without children** = **task**
- Deeper nesting creates sub-tasks naturally

Two additional internal-node types are recognized alongside checkbox
milestones:

- **Group nodes** from subsection headings (`### Title` inside the
  section) and plain bullets with children (`- Group`). A group node has
  no checkbox of its own; it is a named container.
- **Reference roots** from `[[wikilink]]` / `[display](target)` lines,
  which become group nodes whose children are the referenced doc's items.

`###` and other headings **inside** the section are structural — they
become group nodes. Headings at the **same or higher level** than the
section end it.

### Key Properties

- **Section-scoped**: only content within `## GOAL TRACKER` is parsed.
  The rest of the file is free-form notes, ignored by the parser.
- **Two interchangeable formats**: checkbox lists and tables, freely
  mixed within the same section.
- **Minimal metadata**: everything is derived — title from H1, progress
  from checkbox ratio, status from progress.
- **Extensible**: metadata tokens (`@owner`, `#tag`, etc.) can be embedded
  in task text; table columns are auto-mapped by header name.

### Badge (Location)

Each goal displays a **location badge** derived from its file path:
the relative path of the **super directory** of the file's owning
directory.

| File location | Owning dir | Super dir | Badge |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| `ml/llm/stanford-cs146s-2025/README.md` | `ml/llm/stanford-cs146s-2025/` | `ml/llm/` | `ml/llm/` |
| `misc/books/systems-performance/ch13.md` | `misc/books/systems-performance/` | `misc/books/` | `misc/books/` |
| `README.md` (repo root) | `.` (root) | — | `(root)` |

### Derived Fields

| Field | Source | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Title | First H1 in file (fallback: filename) | "Complete CS146s-2025" |
| Progress | `count(done leaf tasks) / count(all leaf tasks)` | 40% |
| Status | Auto from progress | `completed` / `active` / `planned` |

> Full syntax specification: see [syntax.md](syntax.md)

## Inline Tasks

Inline tasks are markers discovered by scanning file contents. They
represent small, atomic tasks embedded directly in code or notes.

**Format:**

```
TODO(scope): description @owner #tag !priority ~due
```

All components except the keyword and description are optional. Bare
`TODO: text` is always valid, making existing markers immediately
parseable.

**Supported keywords:** `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `XXX`, `BUG`
(configurable).

**Example across contexts:**

```c
/* TODO(auth): handle null user @yiqun #security !high ~2025-12-01 */
```

```python
# TODO(perf): optimize scan loop !med
```

```markdown
TODO: add examples for cache types #arch
```

## Feature Catalog

### Scanner

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Recursive walk | Walk entire repo tree from root |
| `.gitignore` awareness | Skip ignored files (via `ignore` crate) |
| Untracked files | Skip files not tracked by git when `only_tracked = true` (default) |
| Binary detection | Skip non-text files (null byte heuristic) |
| File type filtering | Configurable include/exclude globs |
| Max file size | Skip files above threshold (default: 1 MB) |
| Parallel scanning | Multi-threaded file reading (via `rayon`) |
| Both types in one pass | Goals and inline tasks discovered in the same scan |
| Keyword matching | Finds keyword lines via the `regex` crate; `grep-searcher`/`grep-regex` deferred as a later optimization for very large monorepos |

### TUI — Goals & Milestones View

```

**Behaviors:**

- `j`/`k` move, `l` expand, `h` collapse, `Enter` toggle (on a leaf, toggles its parent)
- `Space` toggles a checkbox in the source file
- `e` opens the editor at the selected item's file and line
- `j/k` navigates the tree (goals, milestones, tasks)
- Milestones show per-group ratio (e.g., `2/3`)
- Color coding: done items dimmed, high-priority items highlighted
- Completed goals render dimmed and struck-through; press `C` to collapse
  every fully-complete node (a completed goal, or a milestone that is itself
  `[x]` with all of its leaves checked). `Z` collapses everything in the
  current view.

### TUI — Inline Tasks View

Hierarchical, foldable directory tree showing every inline task
organized by file path. Each item displays line number, keyword,
description, and optional priority badge.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Enter: expand  f: filter  s: sort  g: blame  Tab: Goals  q: quit       │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Tree behaviors:**

- Fold/unfold with `Enter` or `l/h` (vim-style)
- Item counts `[N]` next to each dir/file node
- Inline preview of each task with line number and keyword
- Color coding: priority (red/yellow/gray), keyword (cyan/red/etc.)
- Optional git blame line (toggle with `g`)
- Auto-expand directories containing high-priority tasks

### Inline Expansion

Pressing `Enter` on a specific inline task **expands it in place** within
the tree, showing `context_lines` (default: 2) lines above and below from
the source file. Press `Enter` again to collapse. Context rows are
display-only (non‑selectable, dimmed) and are skipped by the cursor.
No separate panel or view switch — the user keeps their position in the
tree.

### Filtering

Press `f` to open a filter prompt; type a query and press `Enter`. Each term
is `field:value` or free text; all terms are AND-ed. `Esc` clears the active
filter. Filtering applies to the inline tasks view.

| Term | Example | Matches |
|------|---------|---------|
| `kw` / `keyword` | `kw:FIXME` | tasks with that keyword |
| `tag` | `tag:security` | tasks with that tag |
| `owner` | `owner:alice` | tasks owned by that person |
| `pri` / `priority` | `pri:high` | tasks at that priority |
| `path` | `path:auth` | tasks whose path contains the substring |
| `stale` | `stale` | tasks older than the stale threshold |
| *(free text)* | `null user` | tasks whose description contains it |

Not yet implemented: full path globs (`path:` is a substring match today).

### Sorting

Press `s` to cycle sort modes for the inline tasks view. The directory
tree structure is always preserved; the sort affects the order of tasks
within each file and the order files appear within their directory.

| Sort | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Path | Alphabetical by file path (default). |
| Priority | High priority tasks first; within same priority, path order. |
| Keyword | Grouped by keyword (FIXME, then HACK, then TODO, …); within same keyword, path order. |
| Age | Oldest first (requires git blame, Phase 3). |

The current sort mode is shown in the view title. Age sorting depends on
git blame enrichment (Phase 3) and is not available until then.

### Stats Dashboard

Toggle from either view to see aggregate statistics:

- Counts by priority, keyword, and tag (bar charts)
- Top directories by task count
- Stale task count (older than threshold)

### Git Integration

Each inline task can carry git blame data: author, commit date, and short
commit hash. This enables age-based stale detection.

#### Blame enrichment

After inline tasks are parsed, the scanner enriches each task's source
line with blame data via the `git2` crate (libgit2 bindings). One blame
lookup is performed per file (all tasks in the same file share the result),
so performance scales with the number of files, not tasks.

Blame data is stored on each [`InlineTask`]:
- `blame_author: Option<String>` — author name, or `None` if not available
- `blame_date: Option<NaiveDateTime>` — commit date, or `None`
- `blame_commit: Option<String>` — short commit hash (8 chars), or `None`

Enrichment only runs when `display.show_git_blame = true` (default: `true`).
A TUI `g` key toggles blame annotations on inline task rows and goal items.

#### Age and stale detection

A task's **age** is the number of days between today and `blame_date`.
Tasks without blame data (new files, non‑git repos) are never considered
stale.

A task is **stale** when its age exceeds `display.stale_threshold_days`
(default: 365). Stale tasks are flagged in the inline tasks view
(dimmed or shown with a `[stale]` marker) and count towards the stale
total in the stats bar and stats dashboard.

#### Filter integration

The unified filter prompt supports a `stale` term:
- `stale` or `stale:yes` — show only items that are stale.
- `stale` can be combined with other terms, e.g.
  `kw:TODO stale` for stale TODOs.

#### Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `display.show_git_blame` | `true` | Enable blame enrichment (adds git2 overhead) |
| `display.stale_threshold_days` | `365` | Age after which an item is considered stale |

Enabling blame adds a `git2` dependency and a per-scan blame pass. When
`show_git_blame` is `false`, none of the git integration runs and no
`git2` symbols are linked.

### Help System

Press `?` at any time to open a context-sensitive help overlay showing
all keybindings for the current view. Different views have different
keybindings — the overlay adapts.

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Editor Integration

The `e` key suspends the TUI and launches `$EDITOR` (or `$VISUAL`) at
the cursor's file and line number. The TUI resumes when the editor
exits. Falls back to `vi` (Unix) or `notepad` (Windows) if neither
variable is set.

## Logging

trawl logs to a **file**, never the terminal — the TUI uses the alternate
screen, so stderr output would corrupt the display. `--verbose` selects the
`debug` level; otherwise the level is `warn`.

- `--log-file <path>` writes logs to `<path>`.
- Without it, logs go to the platform-conventional location:
  - Linux: `$XDG_STATE_HOME/trawl/trawl.log` (default
    `~/.local/state/trawl/trawl.log`)
  - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/trawl/trawl.log`
  - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\trawl\logs\trawl.log`

Logged events include: skipped unreadable files (`warn`), skipped binary
files (`debug`), walk errors (`warn`), and configuration load (`debug`).

## Configuration

Configuration is layered — later sources override earlier:

```
~/.config/trawl/config.toml        ← user global defaults
<repo>/.trawl.toml                 ← project-level overrides
```

### Project-Level Config (`.trawl.toml`)

A `.trawl.toml` file in the repository root provides per-project
overrides. This is essential for repos like trawl itself, where docs and
test fixtures contain marker patterns that must be excluded from
scanning:

```toml
# .trawl.toml — exclude trawl's own docs and test fixtures
[scan]
exclude = ["docs/", "tests/fixtures/"]
```

### Full Config Reference

```toml
[scan]
keywords = ["TODO", "FIXME", "HACK", "XXX", "BUG"]
keyword_case_sensitive = false
goal_section_names = ["GOAL TRACKER", "TODO"]
include = []  # e.g. ["*.md", "*.rs", "*.py"] — restrict to specific file types
exclude = ["target/", "node_modules/", ".git/"]  # built-in defaults; project config merges with these (union)
max_file_size = "1MB"
scan_hidden = false
only_tracked = true
skip_quoted_keywords = true  # skip keywords inside "..." or `...` (string literals / code spans)

[display]
default_sort = "path"
show_git_blame = true
context_lines = 2
auto_expand_priority = "high"
stale_threshold_days = 365
```

### Scan Filtering Semantics

File filtering uses a layered pipeline — each stage narrows the set of
files passed to the scanner:

| Stage | Source | Behavior |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 1. `.gitignore` | Implicit | Git-ignored files are never scanned |
| 2. untracked | Config | When `only_tracked = true` (default), files not tracked by `git` are skipped |
| 3. `exclude` | Config | Files/dirs matching any glob are skipped (blacklist) |
| 4. `include` | Config | When non-empty, only matching files are scanned (whitelist). When empty (default), no extension restriction applies |
| 5. `scan_hidden` | Config | When `false`, dotfiles and dot-directories are skipped |
| 6. `max_file_size` | Config | Files exceeding the threshold are skipped |
| 7. Binary detection | Heuristic | Files containing null bytes are skipped |

`exclude` is always applied (blacklist). `include` is an optional
whitelist — when omitted or empty, the tool scans all non-ignored,
non-excluded text files, making it repo-agnostic out of the box. The
`include` value shown in the config reference above is illustrative, not
the default.

`exclude` and `include` set in project config **merge** with the built-in
defaults — they extend the default sets (union, de-duplicated) rather than
replacing them. A project that sets `exclude = ["docs/"]` still skips
`target/` and the other built-in defaults; it does not have to re-list them.

All fields are optional with sensible defaults. The `[tokens]` and
`[headers]` sections are **extensible** — users can add custom metadata
types (e.g., `effort = "%"` for effort estimation).

## Phased Implementation Plan
